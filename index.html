  <div class="body-text">
  <p> In 2023, the <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/research/wp-content/uploads/sites/174/2024/05/Spring-2024-Population-Projections-Publication.pdf"> California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR)</a> estimated there were about 94,200 incarcerated individuals statewide. In 2023, there were 62 recorded inmate suicides, and since 2005, an average of 64 inmates a year committed suicide. That translates to about 68 suicides per 100,000 incarcerated individuals, which is about 4.5 times more than the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/suicide#:~:text=100%2C000%20in%202020.-,The%20total%20age%2Dadjusted%20suicide%20rate%20in%20the%20United%20States,females%20(5.9%20per%20100%2C000)."> national suicide rate</a>. Mental health in prisons is a critical issue, with horrible living conditions, a lack of medical care, and continuous exposure to violence contributing to poor mental health. Over the years, inmates have been unable to get the access they need to resources like therapists and psychiatrists. </p>

  <p> To combat this, the CDCR introduced the <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/the-california-model/"> “California Model”</a> in late 2023. This model is built on four pillars: dynamic security, which promotes better relationships between inmates and staff, normalization, which aims to bring prison life close to life outside of prison, peer mentorship, which trains incarcerated individuals to help their peers, and trauma information, which educates staff on trauma. </p>

  <p> While the model hasn’t been in place long enough to evaluate its long-term effectiveness, some previously incarcerated prison advocates like <a href="https://theappeal.org/gavin-newsom-california-model-prison-reform/"> Emile Suotonye DeWeaver</a> say the plan doesn’t have any real effectiveness. After Governor Gavin Newsom announced the new model which included a multi-million dollar plan to revamp San Quentin State Prison, prisoners there said they were <a href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/state gavin-newsom-san-quentin-plan-prompts-lockdown-harassment/article_4a7854aa-fa72-11ed-830c-3b63c9bd3fcc.html"> put into a lockdown</a> as a form of protest by officers, with almost all of their rehabilitative programming removed.</p>

    <p> This disconnect highlights a big issue: the ongoing mental health crisis within prisons. A lack of strong rehabilitation programming—and especially the removal of it—can worsen the already precarious mental health of incarcerated individuals. One of the consequences of this crisis is suicide. A dataset released by The Department of Justice Criminal Justice Statistics Center tracks arrest and custody-related deaths in California from January 2005 to June 2024. These deaths include natural ones, accidental deaths, homicides, and executions. Out of 14,398 total deaths recorded in these nineteen years, 1,390 were labeled as suicide, and 1,236 occurred in custody (while the rest occurred during the process of arrest), meaning nearly 1/10 inmate deaths from 2005-2024 were suicides. </p>

      <p> One notable aspect of the 21st-century inmate suicide rate is the male vs. female suicide rate. The national average for male suicides is approximately <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/data.html"> 4 times higher</a> than females (22.9 per 100,000 vs. 5.9 per 100,000), and this rate is consistent across states. However, in California prisons, the male and female suicide rate is much similar. Females actually experience a slightly higher suicide rate, with 14% of female inmates committing suicide and 11.3% of male inmates committing suicide. This disparity is particularly significant considering men make up about <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/californias-prison-population/"> 96%</a> of the state’s total incarcerated population. </p>

  <p> According to Tom Granucci, a retired California probation officer and mental health treatment specialist, state prisons receive significantly less funding than federal prisons, which means mental health issues for state inmates often go untreated. Even though female inmates report their mental health disorders—most commonly depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder—at a <a href="https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/WomensPathwaysToJail.pdf"> much higher rate</a> than male inmates do, their concerns are often dismissed. A lack of resources in state prisons paired with a stigma around women being “over dramatic” leads to inadequate or no treatment. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation <a href="https://www.cdcr.ca.gov/facility-locator/ciw/#:~:text=This%20facility%20provides%20both%20outpatient,stabilize%20in%20an%20outpatient%20program.">claims</a> they provide treatment for those with a “serious mental health disorder” at the California Institution for Women, a prison that had six inmates die by suicide over an 18 month period. Granucci said statements like these from the CDCR are common, but often don't amount to anything, with no real way to hold the department accountable for their broad claims and with inmates’ issues often deemed not serious enough to treat.</p>

  <p> Another important element of the 2005-2024 CA inmate death dataset is the age distribution of inmate suicides. The majority of suicides occur in the 21 to 50 age range, with the 31 to 40 age range accounting for the highest number of suicides at 395 over the January 2005 to June 2024 period. In contrast, the total number of suicides in the 51 to 81 age range is 205. Because the 31 to 40 age group is one of the <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/californias-prison-population/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20Californians%20aged%2018,olds%20(545%20per%20100K).">most represented</a> among the incarcerated population, it makes sense that they would also experience the highest number of suicides. </p>

 <p> However, Granucci said that a lack of targeted treatment for inmates in state prisons may also contribute to this high suicide rate. According to him, cognitive behavioral therapy, also called psychotherapy, is proven to work best in aiding inmates because it identifies factors other than incarceration that may be contributing to their mental health issues, such as language barriers, family issues, etc. Due to the lack of funding for state prisons, it can be difficult to do this targeted treatment with patients one-on-one, and psychotherapy sessions are frequently conducted in groups consisting of individuals across many different age demographics with varying mental health issues. He explained that this makes it difficult to address specific concerns for middle-aged inmates, many of whom struggle with substance abuse and depression from being in and out of prison for most of their adult lives. This age group is more likely to suffer from <a href="https://www.complextrauma.org/complex-trauma/complex-trauma-what-is-it-and-how-does-it-affect-people/#:~:text=Defining%20Complex%20Trauma,-Never%20Give%20Up&text=Complex%20Trauma%20is%20defined%20as,to%20or%20surviving%20these%20experiences.">“compounded trauma,"</a> a build-up of mental health issues, making targeted treatments critical for them in order to decrease the risk of suicide. </p>

  <p> With underfunding and a lack of targeted resources for specific demographics, the prison mental health crisis has remained a persistent issue in California, and the consistent number of inmate suicides from 2005 to 2024 reflects this. The new “California Model” requires an implementation of targeted mental health treatments to be effective, something which is not currently happening. As evident in the data, every suicide is representative of a lack of adequate care in one of the most vulnerable environments in the state. </p>
